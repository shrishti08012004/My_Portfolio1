🌐 Personal Portfolio Website

This is my personal portfolio website, crafted to highlight my skills, projects, and journey as a developer. It’s designed with a clean, modern UI/UX and built using the latest frontend technologies to ensure a smooth and responsive experience across all devices.

✨ Key Features:

🎨 Minimalist and modern design

📱 Fully responsive layout for desktop and mobile

🧩 Interactive sections showcasing skills, projects, and contact details

📄 Option to view and download my resume directly on your phone

Currently, the frontend is fully functional, while backend integration (such as dynamic content and form handling) is in progress and will be added soon.
